   necessary for programming, while teaching basics of a language.
2. **WIP** "A Guide to Programming" - this teaches how to write useful programs
   that provide value. It describes a simple process how to achieve good
   architecture and incrementally provide more value.

   challenging algorithms. It goes through several examples to understand the
   analysis and design process.
