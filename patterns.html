where value is defined as something of worth to some person or set
of people whom we wish to serve.</p></blockquote><p>Quote: -- <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/value-stream">Value Stream - ScrumPLoP</a></p><div class="premise"><p>There are always a lot of things that could be done, but we can do very little.
It is easy to get lost in the ideas, technical issues and technical debt.
We must make choices in what we do and more importantly things that we won&#39;t do.</p></div><p>The intent of writing software is to create Value to people. Anything that is not
of Value is waste.</p><div class="therefore"><p>Focus on creating Value and how it relates to all the stakeholders and its surroundings.
Ensure that the Value is clear to everyone and fits together with other Values around it.</p></div><div class="separator">Description</div><p>With Value there are two important aspects that must be considered Context and the  Evaluator.</p><p>We cannot understand Value without the Context where it appears. Value is always
connected to other things of Value. We cannot properly evaluate importance
of something without being able to compare it with something else. Hence
we must have a good understanding of the Value and how it relates to other
things surrounding it.</p><div class="example"><p>A door is valuable when it is front of a house.
A keyboard is valuable when it is connected to a computer.
A web server is valuable when it serves content to a browser.</p></div><p>Value is not created for anyone, it is created for someone. We should keep in mind
how the Value enhances and improves the life of the person using it.</p><div class="example"><p>Easy to use GUI interface provides more value to beginners, however it
is slower to use for power-users. A command-line interface is often faster
to use, when learned, but it is more difficult to learn.</p></div><p>Value of something is not a binary scale, there are subtle things that improve or
diminish Value. There are also a lot of things that do not significantly add
to the value.</p><div class="example"><p>A color blind palette choice can make the software easier to use for people with
color deficieny, but is often overlooked. Never relying on only color to distinguish
visual elements is even better.</p></div><div class="example"><p>When writing a prototype or learning, there is little value in good documentation,
good naming conventions and tests. Hence when learning something, do not write
comments or polish it, you can iterate quicker and learn more by skipping those
activities.</p></div><p>There are a many things that can be valuable and it is easy to miss the less
obvious parts. There are things directly related to code:</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/namespaces.md">Value in Namespaces</a> - we need to organize our structures</li></ul><p>to ensure that we have clear distinction between ideas.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/objects.md">Value in Objects</a> - many of the things we write can be</li></ul><p>directly related to the world.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/functions.md">Value in Functions</a> - pure functions provide a reliable and</li></ul><p>repeatable computations.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/logic.md">Value in Logic</a> - describing logical relations between allows</li></ul><p>separating the intent from the way things are computeted.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/interaction.md">Value in Interaction</a> - interaction between things can</li></ul><p>be just as important as the interacting things themselves.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/libraries.md">Value in Libraries</a> - separating ideas into libraries creates</li></ul><p>a possibility for reuse.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/platform.md">Value in Platform</a> - a good platform allows other things</li></ul><p>to be easier and simpler understand.</p><p>There are also things related to the Visuals:</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/ux.md">Value in User Experience</a> - a great experience leads to less</li></ul><p>frustration in people.</p><ul><li><a href="patterns/value/ui.md">Value in User Interface</a> - good interface pleases and guides</li></ul><p>people to making better choices.</p><div class="separator">Evaluation</div><p>To have Strong Value in your code you should understand:</p><ul><li>when it is being used -- in a rush, at work or at leisure time;
where it is being used -- in office, on a bus or on a couch;
how it is being used -- on a desktop computer, on a tablet or a TV;
who is using it -- a power user, a color blind person, a blind person.
how it relates to other Values around it, how they complement each other.</li></ul><div class="separator">Finding</div><p>There are several ways that can be used to find what is Valuable.</p><p>Good <a href="patterns/value/ux.md">User Experience</a> and <a href="patterns/value/ui.md">User Interface</a> show
pieces that are valuable to the end-user. Hence by building the &#34;best&#34;
user-interface you can find some of the strong values.</p><p>Domain Expert terminology and a Domain Expert can directly show what are
the important pieces.</p><div class="separator">Building</div><p>When building Strong Values into your system, start from the strongest and
iteratively work towards adding them. <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/value-stream/greatest-value">1</a></p><p>You may not get the perfect separation into Value structures from the start,
but over-time, since you started with the Strongest Value, they will be
iterated the most.</p><div class="separator">Notes</div><p>The notion of Value very strongly correlates to the notion of Centers in
Christopher Alexanders work. Similarly how centers are composed of other
centers and how centers complement each others, so does Value. <a href="http://www.regismedina.com/articles/christopher-alexander-theory-of-incremental-design">2</a></p><div class="separator">References</div><ul><li><a href="http://www.leansoftwarearchitecture.com/">Lean Architecture</a> by James Coplien

DDD by Eric Evans</li></ul></section><section><h2>Magic Number 4</h2><p>Whenever we are describing or explaining concepts there is a strict limit
how much we can keep in our heads at once. However, if we use few things to
explain things, then we increase the number of &#34;abstraction layers&#34;.</p><p>Therefore</p><p>When describing an concept use 4Â±1 other ideas to explain it.</p><section><h3>Rationale</h3><p>People have a well known limit in their processing capabilities called magic number four.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Capacity) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/).
Anytime we exceed this limit then the explanation of the concept doesn&#39;t fit into our working memory.</p><p>Going the other way, using as few other ideas, doesn&#39;t work either. If we
need in total 5 things to explain something, and we use 2 things to explain each
thing. This in the best case would create two additional ideas or concepts.</p><p>DIAGRAMS</p></section><section><h3>Subtleties</h3><p>This 4+-1 doesn&#39;t mean that you cannot have more than 5 lines in your method.
Or that you cannot have more than 5 ideas in your method. The main thing we are
concerned about is how many concepts does person have hold in their head to
understand.</p><p>By limiting the number lines or ideas per function can do harm. One of such
example is a game loop (link to Carmack).</p><pre><code>while(!exited){
	update mouse
	update systems
	update entities
	draw entites
	draw hud
	blit to screen
}</code></pre><pre><code>update(){
	update mouse
	update systems
	update entities
}

draw(){
	draw entites
	draw hud
}

while(!exited){
	update()
	draw()
	blit to screen
}</code></pre><p>We have increased our LOC, without actually reducing the complexity. The first
case is perfectly understandable, we need to keep in mind that we are in
the <code>while</code> loop and any specific action we are doing.</p><p>If grouping is necessary, we can use empty blocks:</p><pre><code>while(!exited){
	{
		update mouse
		update systems
		update entities
	}
	{
		draw entites
		draw hud
	}
	blit to screen
}</code></pre></section><section><h3>Extremes</h3><p>This doesn&#39;t mean there are cases where that this bounds shouldn&#39;t be broken.
Sometimes the essential complexity of the idea requires multiple things. Sometimes it&#39;s not necessary to use more ideas.</p><p>Distributed algorithms can easily violate these rules, because you need to account
for different kinds of failures and failovers. We can take (quorum) algorithm.
In those cases human verification becomes difficult or near impossible.
We can use program verification to prove properties of the system.
Alternatively we can substitute them with easier to understand algorithms,
such as Raft, that may not have as good properties, but we are less likely to
make a mistake in it&#39;s implementation.</p><p>Now when you don&#39;t have 3 things to explain your idea, which can often be the
case when implementing trivial things, there&#39;s not point in inventing new things
to satisfy the constraint.</p></section></section><section><h2>Structure Follows Value</h2></section></section><section><h1>Building</h1><section><h2>Spiking</h2></section><section><h2>Gradual Stiffening</h2></section><section><h2>Import Namespaces</h2></section><section><h2>DAG of Namespaces</h2></section><section><h2>Organizational Folder</h2></section></section></body></html>
