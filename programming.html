<p>There is one timeless way of building.
It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been.
The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents
and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by
people who were very close to the center of this way.</p>

<p>What is the timeless way of building programs?
What makes programs beautiful?
How do you create programs from nothing?
How do you ensure that the program architecture is beautiful?</p>

<p>This book guides you through building several programs from start to deployment.
It is meant to give insight how to incrementally develop architecture without
big upfront investment. Hopefully, it will also provide some insight into the
questions asked previously.</p>

<p>During programming it is very easy to get lost in all the small implementation
details. Then again, when looking at the large picture, it is easy to miss small
important details. These views must be balanced and treated equally, otherwise
the code will suffer.</p>

<p>This introduction will describe the general process and terminology that will be
used throughout the book.</p>

<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>It's not for you Jen.</p>

<p>Obviously, no book is perfect for everyone, so it helps to clarify what is
expected from the reader.</p>

<p>First, you should be familiar with programming. It is not necessary that you
have written a big program, however it could help you to understand the issues
better.</p>

<p>Second, you should be able to search and learn the necessary implementation
details on your own. For example, when the book requires the use of HTML, the
reader should go and learn about it. It will go into technical details only
when it is necessary.</p>

<p>Third, this book uses Go, but the same principles apply to any language. The
building process is the constant between languages, although the implementation
details can vary significantly. If you are not familiar with Go then please
learn the basics before proceeding.</p>

<p>Throughout this book we will be doing many decisions that may not make the
best business sense. For example, you shouldn't start building a issue tracker
unless you have a clear ROI in mind. We may make decisions that you disagree
with, these are not the important part in this book. These decisions are made
during development when we don't know full information on what problems will
come ahead. There will be decisions that could have made our lives easier
or used a better library and so on... but this is the reality of programming:
you won't make the best decisions every time.</p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>... starting in The Mist, you are seeking ways to create Value,
where value is defined as something of worth to some person or set
of people whom we wish to serve.</p>
<footer><span class="quote-who"> <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/value-stream">Value Stream - ScrumPLoP</a>
</span></footer></blockquote>

<p>Why do we write programs in the first place?</p>

<p>Obviously we want to provide <strong><em>value</em></strong> to people, not waste.
This is why <strong><em>value</em></strong> is so important, it helps us ground in search for solutions.
It helps us understand why we are doing things in the first place.
If you are not creating something of <strong><em>value</em></strong> then you are creating waste.</p>

<h3 id="valuable">Valuable</h3>

<p>To understand <strong><em>value</em></strong> we must first understand why do we call things <strong><em>valuable</em></strong>.</p>

<p>In the simplest terms when X is <strong><em>valuable</em></strong> to someone Y it means,
that X has importance to Y, it can bring benefit to Y in some way.</p>

<p>This is not rocket science:</p>

<ul>
<li>the internet is valuable because it can connect people to information with very little cost,</li>
<li>a keyboard is valuable because it allows to interact with the computer and</li>
<li>an text editor is valuable because it allows to modify and adjust text with ease.</li>
</ul>

<p>We know and feel when something is valuable to us and we can emphatize
when something is valuable to someone else. We should embrace this inner
feeling and let it guide us.</p>

<h3 id="the-context">The Context</h3>

<p>However, understanding <strong><em>value</em></strong> is not that easy. We must always bear in mind
that the <strong><em>value</em></strong> something possesses is deeply tied in the context where
it exists.</p>

<ul>
<li>If there isn't information on the internet, then it's not as valuable.</li>
<li>If there is no computer for the keyboard, then the keyboard is not useful.</li>
<li>If you have nothing to write, then a text editor is not valuable.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is all common sense, but these examinations help us examine more important
questions. Let's take something more difficult.</p>

<p><em>Does 'logging in to a system' have value?</em>
First reaction would be to say, <em>&quot;Yes, of course it does.?&quot;</em>
But, have you ever said, <em>&quot;I got so much value from logging in to the system?&quot;</em>
I doubt it. Should we conclude that <em>&quot;No, of course logins have no value, they are only an annoyance?&quot;</em></p>

<p>As you may have already guessed, neither answer is correct.
The goal of &quot;logging in&quot; is to protect <strong><em>value</em></strong>, rather than to be of <strong><em>value</em></strong>.
If there is no login screen for a system that you don't use, then it is not of
importance to you.
When it's a online bank login, the login is as valuable to you, as how much money
you have on your accounts.
For the banks the login system is very important, although it may not be of any value.</p>

<p>It's not as simple as <em>&quot;Does login have value?&quot;</em>, the <strong><em>value</em></strong> of something
will be deeply tied to where it happens.</p>

<h3 id="evaluator">Evaluator</h3>

<p>You should also have noticed that the value will also depend on who is
doing the evaluating. We have to keep in mind that there is always a evaluator
when looking at value.</p>

<p>When creating value we should always look through the eyes of the person
that we are creating the value for. And the person we provide value
for can change. Let's say we are building a wooden-box.</p>

<p>In the simplest case we are providing value for the end-user.
You make a wooden-box and the end-user uses it.</p>

<ol>
<li>We could provide value to some other person in your team.
You cut few boards and give them to another person to assemble.
The end-user really doesn't care about those boards, they are not valuable to him.</li>
<li>We could provide value to ourselves.
I make a jig that allows me to cut boards faster and with less effort.
Neither the person doing the assembly or end-user won't care about the jig.</li>
<li>All of these things help to provide value to the end-user. It is something
that we must keep in our minds, value helps to create <strong><em>value</em></strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We shouldn't restrict our minds to creating &quot;boxes&quot;, but rather see the
bigger picture. How is the box valuable to the end-user, how will he use it.
Does he hold very lightweight things there - this means we can make the box
sides thinner and reduce waste. Does he use different things there, maybe we
can add separators into the box.</p>

<p>Understanding what is created and why things are valuable to people is
essential to making good decisions, in general.</p>

<h3 id="outside-the-box">Outside the box</h3>

<p>We should have a bigger view and understand that we can get same value
from multiple solutions. Engineering is about understanding those different
solutions and deciding which is the most appropriate.</p>

<p>When we look at the &quot;logging in to a system&quot; case.
If the data can be public, then we won't need a login.
Are we only using it on our own computer, no login necessary.
Are we only using it from within a intranet, no login necessary.</p>

<p>Look for multiple solutions, you can avoid a lot of work this way.</p>

<h3 id="decisions">Decisions</h3>

<p>Value will be at the core at our decision making, it helps to give us clarity
why we are doing something and not doing something else.
Always understand what the <strong><em>value</em></strong> is for the end-user,
because there all the things built must come together.</p>

<p>All of this talk about <strong><em>value</em></strong> may seem fluffy, but we will soon put all
this understanding to the test.</p>

<h2 id="building">Building</h2>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
<p>Speaking as a builder, if you start something, you must have a vision of the
thing which arises from your instinct about preserving and enhancing
what is there... If you're working correctly, the feeling doesn't wander about.</p>
<footer><span class="quote-who"> Christopher Alexander
</span></footer></blockquote>

<p>The most important part of programming is that you cannot do everything at once.
The human mind is fairly limited how much it can hold in its head at a time.
To combat this limitation we need to build things piece-by-piece to ensure
that everything will fit together nicely.</p>

<p>Following patterns are invaluable to building something with ease and clearity.</p>

<h3 id="structure-follows-value">Structure Follows Value</h3>

<p>We dedicated a lot of time explaining what value is and why it is important.
To ensure that we actually build something of value, we need to understand
the value it provides and how it provides it.</p>

<p>By dissecting and deconstructing value we are able to find boundaries that
align with the problem domain.</p>

<h3 id="spiking">Spiking</h3>

<p>To ensure that we get a good global view how things will interact we
put up several spikes and imagine everything working together. This helps
to iterate much faster on the larger view without being slowed down by
techinical details.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-stiffening">Gradual Stiffening</h3>

<p>To accomodate all the issues that arises from integrating different pieces
we gradually make the code more solid. This allows better detection on any
problems that may arise.</p>

<h3 id="cleanup">Cleanup</h3>

<p>This always happens in tandem with gradual stiffening and should be done to
finish that everything is correct and in order.</p>

<h3 id="putting-them-together">Putting them together</h3>

<p>It might not be easy to comprehend this without practical examples, but the
easiest way to understand is to imagine this with drawing.</p>

<p>You don't start drawing from the top-left corner and proceed to the right
side, and then the next line. First you figure out, what you are drawing
and what are the things you are going to draw (structure follows value).
Then you do few rough sketches until you see that the drawing will work nicely (spiking).
Then you start to refine the sketches, then you draw properly with a pen (gradual stiffening).
Then you clean all the sketch lines and color it (cleanup).</p>

<p>The principle for programming is the same.</p>

<h1 id="issue-tracker">Issue Tracker</h1>

<p>Our first case study will be an <em>issue tracker</em>. Probably you have seen one and
use one, that way it will be easy to discuss. The code for this project can
be found at <a href="http://github.com/loov/tracker">github.com/loov/tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Since we already stated that <strong><em>value</em></strong> will be very dependent
on the context. So, here is our facilitated situation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a company of 40 people and contains 8 teams.
Some problems inside teams take too much time to solve
and there is no proper visibility on the issues that the
team must solve. When a issue moves from person to person
and team to team there is no direct knowledge how much
has been done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scrum suggests that a <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/product-organization-pattern-language/development-team" title="Development Team - Scrum PloP">Development Team</a> must work as one unit instead
of single individuals to achieve the best performance. Many issue trackers
take the other approach, an issue is assigned to a specific person. Our goal
will be to create an issue tracker that handles only teams.</p>

<p>Of course, you may not disagree with this goal, but nevertheless it serves
as a good starting point for implementing something new. Going forward, there
can be many decisons about value and importance that you may not agree with.
It is fine to disagree with these points, they are there because we need some
decision to go forward with the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="an-issue">An Issue</h2>

<p>Here is our first important question. <em>&quot;What provides value in an Issue Tracker?&quot;</em></p>

<p>We may notice the important pieces from the language used.</p>

<pre><code>&quot;What are we working on?&quot;
&quot;I need to finish this issue.&quot;
&quot;I don't have good visibility on the issues.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We may also get this information from a domain expert. In our case it is
obvious, the most important thing is an <strong><em>issue</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here we should think, why <strong><em>issue</em></strong> is important:</p>

<ul>
<li>It shows what we are doing.</li>
<li>It shows what we have done.</li>
<li>It shows what we still need to do.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Issue</em></strong> is definitely a valuable part of Tracker hence we must capture
it in code.</p>

<h3 id="contain-it">Contain it</h3>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/tracker/tree/bd9af4dcda0207555204bad0addcd0ce4d0a61dc">bd9af4dcda</a></p>

<p>To ensure that we can capture <strong><em>issue</em></strong> and do not lose the knowledge
about it's importance we should create a namespace for it. That way we make
it significant and important. At the same time we create a locus of attention
which allows to understand and examine the feature wholly and whether it
is complete.</p>

<p>Of course, namespaces are not the only way to contain things - there are also
packages, classes, functions, methods, constraints etc. What you use to contain
will depend on how large, detailed or important the contained thing is.</p>

<p>It is better to start with a notch larger container than is needed, it is not
difficult to make it smaller. However the reverse, moving from smaller container
to larger, is usually more difficult.</p>

<p><strong><em>Issue</em></strong> is a very important concept, hence we start with a package <code>issue</code>.
Our starting folder structure will be:</p>

<pre><code>/main.go <span class="callout">1</span>
/issue/
</code></pre>

<p>It is clear that at somepoint we will need <code>main.go</code> <span class="callout">1</span>, so we can add it now -
although, when we add it doesn't matter.</p>

<h3 id="spike-it">Spike it</h3>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/tracker/tree/9f47cfaaeadbaa999dc36fd238684151bb9bc6e4">9f47cfaaea</a></p>

<p>We should try to figure out what our <code>issue</code> contains. Create <code>issue/info.go</code>
with:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package issue

type ID int                     <span class="callout">1</span>
type Status string              <span class="callout">2</span>

const (
    Created Status = &quot;Created&quot;  <span class="callout">3</span>
    Closed         = &quot;Closed&quot;
)

type Info struct {              <span class="callout">4</span>
    ID      ID
    Caption string
    Desc    string
    Status  Status
}
</code></pre>

<p>We must have an <code>issue.ID</code> <span class="callout">1</span> to uniquely identify an issue. Each issue usually
has an <code>issue.Status</code> <span class="callout">2</span><span class="callout">3</span> associated with it. We need something to bring all
the attributes together <span class="callout">4</span>. Keep in mind we are sketching the code and are not
committed to this structure. We are not looking perfection, but rather a
global view how things will work together.</p>

<p>Notice that I don't use long names such as <code>IssueStatus</code>, <code>IssueInfo</code> because
the namespace for them already contains name <code>issue</code>. We should always leverage
our namespace for naming. The full name for them are <code>issue.Status</code> and <code>issue.Info</code>
which help to clarify.</p>

<p>We also need some way to store and load those issues. The way we store and load
them can change, hence we should abstract this knowledge away. We create an
interface <code>issue.Manager</code> for it. We put it into <code>issue/manager.go</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package issue

type Manager interface {
    Create(info Info) (ID, error)
    Load(id ID) (Info, error)
    Close(id ID) (error)
    List() (issues []Info, error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>To get a overview how we will use it, we write some usage code into <code>main.go</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;

    &quot;github.com/loov/tracker/issue&quot;
)

func check(err error) {
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}

func main() {
    var manager issue.Manager

    id, err := manager.Create(issue.Info{
        Caption: &quot;Hello&quot;,
        Desc: &quot;World&quot;,
        Status: issue.Created,
    })
    check(err)

    info, err := manager.Load(id)
    check(err)

    fmt.Println(info)

    infos, err := manager.List()
    check(err)
    fmt.Println(infos)
}
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't matter in which order you create these pieces, sometimes it is easier
to create the usage code first, other times it is easier to create the implementation
first. The thing that does matter is that both exist to ensure that we have
the implementation details right and that we can integerate it with rest of the
code.</p>

<p>The usage code can also be sketched as a test, this depends on how the sketched
code will be used, how it needs to integerate with the rest of the system and
other factors.</p>

<h3 id="gradual-stiffening-1">Gradual stiffening</h3>

<p>Notice that we actually don't have any runnable code yet, it's fine, because
until now we were trying to grasp what we are implementing and that all the
pieces work together as intended.</p>

<p>Now we will step-by-step start to flesh out the actual structure, until we
have solid and good runnable code. We are in our beginning stages of our project
so there really isn't much to worry about. We should skim over our code and
notice anything that doesn't feel nice.</p>

<p>The first thing we may notice is <code>issue.Created</code>. What would
<code>info.Status == issue.Created</code> mean? This suggests that we haven't captured the
intent as well as we should have. Let's refine our sketch, <code>info.Status == issue.Open</code>
sounds much better, hence we change <code>issue/info.go</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">const (
    Open Status = &quot;Open&quot;
    Done        = &quot;Done&quot;
)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>main.go</code> the <code>manager</code> doesn't feel solid, it feels like a fuzzy concept
without specific meaning. There probably will be more things that need to &quot;manage&quot;
things. Is there a better name for it?</p>

<p>What does the <code>manager</code> do? <em>&quot;It manages and tracks issues.&quot;</em> Here is a clue
for a nicer name <code>Tracker</code>. We shall refine <code>issue/manager.go</code> into <code>issue/tracker.go</code>
and change:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package issue

type Tracker interface {
    Create(info Info) (ID, error)
    Load(id ID) (Info, error)
    Close(id ID) (error)
    List() (issues []Info, error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also do all the necessary adjustments to <code>main.go</code>. At the end of this we
should have code that compiles however it's fine if it is not yet completely
bug-free. We will do this in the next step, however gradual stiffening together
with cleanup should be mixed it will always end with a final cleanup pass.</p>

<h3 id="cleanup-1">Cleanup</h3>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/tracker/tree/56f7a0930c1715deeef9e1cf18924353d4968d44">56f7a0930c</a></p>

<p>Now we have a good idea about the feature and how to put it into code,
we shall go over and fill in all the missing details and ensure that we
have comments and a few tests and are able to use it in some form.</p>

<p>Here we add a stub implementation for the tracker and then write some tests
for the tracker.</p>

<p>Cleanup code -- means now that you have figured out the sketch, you can
go and trace over it with nice clean looking lines, using the ruler and
delete all the messy bits.</p>

<p>The other thing what we want to do here is to make easier to understand
and ensure whether the code really behaves as it should. In most cases you would
want unit or behavior tests, but they are not the only way. You could also
write property tests. Or write output that could be verified by hand,
if the correct behavior is difficult to describe in code.</p>

<p>Few interesting bits while solidifying code. When you come across questions,
mark them as such. For example while writing the tracker test case, I made a
mistake while writing:</p>

<pre><code>    //file: issue/tracker_test.go
    tracker.Close(id)
    // ...
    expect := Info{
        ID:      id,
        Caption: &quot;Caption&quot;,
        Desc:    &quot;Desc&quot;,
        Status:  Closed,     // &lt;--- error, should be Done
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I mixed up two things: the method is called &quot;Close&quot; and the resulting
status is &quot;Done&quot;. Because I made a mistake while writing this, it suggests to
me that the code is not clear enough... but I'm not sure how to improve it.
It probably isn't that important, so I'll mark it as a TODO and move on
to other things:</p>

<pre><code>// file: issue/info.go
const (
    //TODO: should tracker.Create renamed to &quot;Open&quot;, because status is Open
    Open = Status(&quot;Open&quot;) // Open means that the issue needs to be worked on
    //TODO: should &quot;Done&quot; be renamed to &quot;Closed&quot;, because tracker has method Close
    Done = Status(&quot;Done&quot;) // Done means that the issue is completed and delivered
)
</code></pre>

<p>I could try to figure out this immediately, but I really don't think I have
necessary information right now and I will probably find out the details
while implementing other things.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-done">Is it done?</h3>

<p>Now we have captured something of value in code. It can't be used easily
right now, but we have something that someone would like to use.</p>

<p>It might look that it was a really involved process that created only these
few lines of code. In reality, it's pretty fluid and moves quite quickly. The
only reason it looks involved is because I tried to write down everything I
was thinking while writing the code.</p>

<h1 id="timeclock">Timeclock</h1>

<p>I was asked how difficult it would be to implement a something to show project progress for a welding company. I thought it would be a great case-study.</p>

<p>In the <em>issue tracker</em> we took things very slow to show the ideas behind building something. Here we will try to go at full speed. How much you can do at the same time will depend on your skill level and previous knowledge of the domain. The code for this project can
be found at <a href="http://github.com/loov/worksheet">github.com/loov/worksheet</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-discussion">The discussion</h2>

<p>Here's the translated chat about the project:</p>

<p>C - Customer; A: Analyst.</p>

<pre><code>C: Hi, how difficult would it to make a webpage where
   workers can login and add worked hours to different
   projects plus any materials that were used and have
   an option to add pictures.
A: It depends how much different things are added.
   It shouldn't be too difficult, probably there
   already exist things that do that.
C: Yes, there is, it costs about ~150€ per month for
   single user, also they don't solve our problems very
   well. I asked the pricing for some 20 users, it was
   ~6000€.
A: If there isn't any complicated business problems
   and there is no need for old browser support, then it
   should be fairly simple.
C: Wait I'll make a quick diagram, how it should work.
</code></pre>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/project-sketch.png" alt="Project sketch"></figure></p>

<pre><code>C: Every user gets a login user and password.
   Only supervisor can change things.
A: Do you need any summary/statistics pages?
C: Yes, that would be useful.

A: Who will create the projects?
C: The supervisor.
A: What information needs to be associated with each project?
C: If it's a project with fixed pricing then it calculates
   how much has been spent and whether balance is positive
   or negative.

A: How will the balance be calculated?
C: Hours and materials.
A: Does every worker have the same hour cost?
   Or does it vary between projects?
C: Usually the cost per hour is same, except workshop hours.
A: Always or usually?
C: For different orders it can be different. You should be
   able to change the pricing.

A: Can the whole thing be in English or does it need to
   be localized?
C: Translation is a small problem.
A: It's not about the translating part, rather whether
   there should be built-in support for multiple languages.

A: How should changing pricing look like?
   Should it need some default values that will be used
   and can be overridden depending on the project?
   Will they change during project?
C: The pricing will be fixed when the project is created
   and won't be changed later.

A: Do you need something for sub-projects or sub-tasks?
C: Yes, that might come in handy.
A: Do you need multi-level or is a two-level separation
   sufficient?
   Project -&gt; Objective X -&gt; Task A;
   or Project -&gt; Objective A.
C: Two-level separation would be sufficient.

A: How will the worker mark down material usage?
   By price, amount or something else?
C: When project is created then the material usage is
   already known. But worker should be able to say that
   instead of 4 bolts we actually needed 6.
A: So will he write:
   2 bolts priced at 8€ per piece
   2 bolts, type XYZ and get the price from system?
C: Yup, the latter one.

A: Can the bolt price change during the project and how
   should it be handled, let's say there is:

   1. In a project it's marked that 2 bolts were used.
   2. Then price of that bolt changes.

   Should the price be at the time 1. or 2.
C: At moment 1.

A: How does the worker mark down his status?
   I worked on X for 4hours?
   How should the work hour pricing be calculated?
   Does it have to be legally valid from an accounting
   standpoint or is it only for internal tracking?
C: For workers we only track the hours, accounting
   manages the payments separately. Important are
   materials and cost per hour.

<p>This whole discussion took about 1hour. This seems like
a lot of jumping around instead of a rigid discussion, but
it conveys sufficient information about the project to
make a prototype.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This isn't some magic syntax, it's pseudo-code of artifacts.
Here I decided to track work-hours and materials as &quot;Expense&quot;
instead of separate entities, it will add some uniformity to the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="prototype">Prototype</h3>

<p>I'm sure that we don't have full understanding of the business logic,
but we do understand how things are related. It will be sufficient to create
a prototype.</p>

<p>Note, that it is a concious desicion to stop analysis at this point.
This is the minimal viable product that provides value to the customer.
I'm not sure whether customer would be to imagine all the intricacies
even if I asked them. I might get wrong or guesses instead of good answers.
We need something solid, something that the customer can try out.</p>

<p>There are several ways we could build the prototype: paper mock-ups, wireframes,
some prototyping software, HTML page, actual code.
Use whatever you feel most comfortable fastest with.
In this case the webpage seems pretty trivial so there is no need for paper
mock-ups or wireframes. We can go directly to HTML or code.</p>

<h2 id="project">Project</h2>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/timeclock/tree/3e1add335e723017366d5ff0e5c66dfab44a98a2">3e1add335e</a></p>

<p>In the previous chapter we created a sketch of data structures that we might need. Let us convert it into code.</p>

<p>Our first qestion should be: &quot;What are the most valuable pieces from: <code>Resource</code>, <code>Customer</code>, <code>Worker</code>, <code>Project</code>, <code>Task</code>, <code>Expense</code>, <code>Comment</code>, <code>Attachment</code>?&quot;</p>

<p>We should pick some of them that we can maintain in our heads at the same time. It should stay between 3-6. 1-2 items at a time can give you tunnel vision with regards to integrating different pieces. More than 6, it becomes impossible to keep all the pieces in your head together.</p>

<p>The main goal of the program is to track projects. So, I would pick <code>Project</code>, <code>Task</code>, <code>Resource</code> and <code>Expense</code> as our first iteration.</p>

<h3 id="project-1">Project</h3>

<p>We start with describing the project information:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type Project struct {
    Title       string
    Customer    string //TODO: ref
    Pricing     Pricing
    Description string
    Status      Status
}

type Status string

const (
    Queued     Status = &quot;Queued&quot;
    InProgress        = &quot;In Progress&quot;
    Done              = &quot;Done&quot;
    Delivered         = &quot;Delivered&quot;
)

//TODO: is there a better name for this?
type Pricing struct {
    Hours float64
    Price float64
}

type Task struct {
    Title       string
    Description string
    Status      Status
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may notice we have replaced proper references to other identifiers and items with a simple string.
This helps us bootstrap things faster.
That way we don't have to think about many things.</p>

<h3 id="resource">Resource</h3>

<p>For the resource we try to write the minimal and guessing
how some things should be represented:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type Resource struct {
    Name string
    Unit Unit
    PPU  float64 // price per unit
}

type Expense struct {
    Worker   string //TODO: ref
    Date     time.Time
    Resource Resource
    Units    float64
    Price    float64
}

type Unit string

const (
    Litre = &quot;l&quot;
    Grams = &quot;g&quot;
    Piece = &quot;&quot;
)
</code></pre>

<p>I was also thinking whether to separate <code>Resource</code> into
a separate package or not. There might be some resource
management needed and more complicated logic. If we need,
we can always separate it.</p>

<h2 id="server">Server</h2>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/timeclock/tree/c420b57de35a12d2ce78c63cf24c030927bccb5b">c420b57de3</a></p>

<p>Now that we have represented the <code>Project</code> we should
try to expose it. This means having a server and frontend.</p>

<p>For the server we shall go with the standard http library
and for the frontend with plain-old-HTML. We shouldn't use
JavaScript in this project because the users are likely
to have older browsers and this will make the implementation
more likely to work on any platform.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>I'm going with my usual server setup in <code>main.go</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    &quot;flag&quot;
    &quot;net/http&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;
)

var (
    addr = flag.String(&quot;listen&quot;, &quot;:8000&quot;, &quot;http server `address`&quot;) <span class="callout">1</span>
)

func main() {
    flag.Parse()

    host, port := os.Getenv(&quot;HOST&quot;), os.Getenv(&quot;PORT&quot;) <span class="callout">2</span>
    if host != &quot;&quot; || port != &quot;&quot; {
        *addr = host + &quot;:&quot; + port
    }

    assets := http.FileServer(http.Dir(&quot;assets&quot;))
    http.Handle(&quot;/assets/&quot;, http.StripPrefix(&quot;/assets/&quot;, assets)) <span class="callout">3</span>

    http.HandleFunc(&quot;/&quot;, index) <span class="callout">4</span>

    log.Println(&quot;Starting server on&quot;, *addr)
    http.ListenAndServe(*addr, nil)
}

func index(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    http.ServeFile(w, r, &quot;index.html&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We add <code>addr</code><span class="callout">1</span> to allow configuring the listen address.
We override<span class="callout">2</span> the configuration from environment variables -
this way I can use <a href="https://github.com/codegangsta/gin">gin</a>
to automatically recompile the server.
We serve <code>assets</code> <span class="callout">3</span> for any static files, such as css.
We show a simple <code>index.html</code><span class="callout">4</span> page to see whether our server actually
works as intended.</p>

<p><code>index.html</code> contains nothing special:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Timeclock&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/assets/css/main.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Timeclock&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly <code>/assets/css/main.css</code> contains minimal reset:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

body, html {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    color: #333;

    letter-spacing: 0.02em;

    -ms-word-wrap: break-all;
    word-wrap: break-word;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The basic html/css setup might vary. You could use some standard css setup
such as <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">skeleton.css</a> or
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a>, to speed up your workflow.</p>

<p>We test our server with <code>gin .</code> and see whether <code>localhost:3000</code> shows something.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-project-info">Viewing project info</h3>

<p><a class="sha" href="https://github.com/loov/timeclock/tree/4ef17bc635874534b6474f73384bcabb403bf9b2">4ef17bc635</a></p>

<p>After we ensure that the server is working, we make the page
show some mock project information. We convert server to use
<code>html/template</code>.</p>

<p>We also add a function to handle any internal errors... note it should use minimally anything that we build. Otherwise, if we use a broken thing to display broken thing we might cause very severe errors.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func internalError(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, err error) {
    message := template.HTMLEscapeString(err.Error())
    page := fmt.Sprintf(`
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Timeclock&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/assets/css/main.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
`, message)
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    w.Write([]byte(page))
}

func index(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    t, err := template.ParseFiles(&quot;index.html&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf(&quot;error parsing template: %v&quot;, err)
        internalError(w, r, err)
        return
    }

    example := &amp;project.Project{
        Title:    &quot;Alpha&quot;,
        Customer: &quot;ACME&quot;,
        Pricing: project.Pricing{
            Hours: 480,
            Price: 1000,
        },
        Description: &quot;Implement views&quot;,
        Status:      project.InProgress,
    }

    err = t.Execute(w, example)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf(&quot;error parsing template: %v&quot;, err)
        internalError(w, r, err)
        return
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We also adjust the <code>index.html</code> to use project information:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class=&quot;project&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;{{.Title}}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;table class=&quot;info&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{.Customer}}&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td class=&quot;description&quot; rowspan=&quot;4&quot;&gt;{{.Description}}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Status&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{.Status}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hours&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{.Pricing.Hours}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{.Pricing.Price}}€&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We also made some adjustments to the .css to make it look nicer.</p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/project-info-00.png" alt="Project View 00" title="Project header"><figcaption>Project header</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Then we add a way to view expenses:</p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/project-info-01.png" alt="Project View 01" title="More information"><figcaption>More information</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before proceeding we can ask users whether this is
what they were looking for. This is so we can understand
whether we are on the right track.</p>

<h2 id="feedback-1">Feedback #1</h2>

<p>After showing the first prototype to users, they gave some
feedback and they sketched out some other views.</p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-worker-view.png" alt="Worker View" title="Worker view"><figcaption>Worker view</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-worker-view.png" alt="Worker Project View" title="Worker project view"><figcaption>Worker project view</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-view.png" alt="Customer View" title="Customer view"><figcaption>Customer view</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-project-view.png" alt="Customer Project View" title="Customer project view"><figcaption>Customer project view</figcaption></figure></p>

<p><figure><img src="programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-project-view.png" alt="Customer Project Date View" title="Customer project date view"><figcaption>Customer project date view</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>They also said that the &quot;Project Date View&quot; should contain a
place for comments and discussion and that when the project
has fixed pricing, then the <code>Customer</code> shouldn't be able to
view how many hours workers worked.</p>

<p>From these views we can deduce several things. First merging
resource use and worker work-time into a single thing isn't
probably a good idea. It will be better if we break it up.</p>
