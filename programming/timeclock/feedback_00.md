After showing the first prototype to users, they gave some
feedback and they sketched out some other views.

Worker View:

Worker Project View:

Customer View:

Customer Project Date View:

They also said that the "Project Date View" should contain a
place for comments and discussion and that when the project
has fixed pricing, then the `Customer` shouldn't be able to
view how many hours workers worked.

From these views we can deduce several things. First merging
resource use and worker work-time into a single thing isn't
probably a good idea. It will be better if we break it up.
