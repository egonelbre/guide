After showing the first prototype to users, they gave some
feedback and they sketched out some other views.

![Worker View](programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-worker-view.png "Worker view")

![Worker Project View](programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-worker-view.png "Worker project view")

![Customer View](programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-view.png "Customer view")

![Customer Project View](programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-project-view.png "Customer project view")

![Customer Project Date View](programming/timeclock/images/feedback-00-customer-project-view.png "Customer project date view")

They also said that the "Project Date View" should contain a
place for comments and discussion and that when the project
has fixed pricing, then the `Customer` shouldn't be able to
view how many hours workers worked.

From these views we can deduce several things. First merging
resource use and worker work-time into a single thing isn't
probably a good idea. It will be better if we break it up.
