As an example case-study we'll take *issue tracker*. Probably you have seen
one and maybe used one, so it's an easy enough example to understand.

We start with a simple premise:

A company of 40 people have problems seeing all the issues that the company
is facing and that need to be solved. Traditional issue trackers don't have
the clarity that they need.

> Note: there are issue trackers that probably do what we are going to build.
> It can make more business sense to buy an Issue Tracker instead of building
> your own. This "Issue Tracker" is for learning purposes and we make
> decisions that may not be the best business decisions, although
> they will provide more learning experience.
