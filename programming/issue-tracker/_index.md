Our first case study will be an *issue tracker*. Probably you have seen one and
use one, that way it will be easy to discuss. The code for this project can
be found at [github.com/loov/tracker](http://github.com/loov/tracker).

Since we already stated that ***value*** will be very dependent
on the context. So, here is our facilitated situation:

> There is a company of 40 people and contains 8 teams.
> Some problems inside teams take too much time to solve
> and there is no proper visibility on the issues that the
> team must solve. When a issue moves from person to person
> and team to team there is no direct knowledge how much
> has been done.

Scrum suggests that a [Development Team][] must work as one unit instead
of single individuals to achieve the best performance. Many issue trackers
take the other approach, an issue is assigned to a specific person. Our goal
will be to create an issue tracker that handles only teams.

Of course, you may not disagree with this goal, but nevertheless it serves
as a good starting point for implementing something new. Going forward, there
can be many decisons about value and importance that you may not agree with.
It is fine to disagree with these points, they are there because we need some
decision to go forward with the implementation.
