I should clarify for whom this book is for. It is intended for people who already know how to write code, how to learn on their own and search answers on the internet on their own.

It will not go into technical details, unless they are relevant to the problem at hand. If I skip technical details, I will point to appropriate links that describe it in depth. If you feel that something should contain such link, let me know.

Although most of the examples are in `Go` the principles should work in other languages. However, some of the exact details how you ensure package boundaries is different.
