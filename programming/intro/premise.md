Obviously, no book is perfect for everyone, so it helps to clarify what is
expected from the reader.

First, you should be familiar with programming. It is not necessary that you
have written a big program, however it could help you to understand the issues
better.

Second, you should be able to search and learn the necessary implementation
details on your own. For example, when the book requires the use of HTML, the
reader should go and learn about it. It will go into technical details only
when it is necessary.

Third, this book uses Go, but the same principles apply to any language. The
building process is the constant between languages, although the implementation
details can vary significantly. If you are not familiar with Go then please
learn the basics before proceeding.
