	<quote by="Christopher Alexander" class="epigraph">There is one timeless way of building. It is a thousand years old, and the same today as it has ever been. The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were very close to the center of this way.</quote>

		<li>What is the timeless way of building programs?</li>
		<li>What makes programs beautiful?</li>
		<li>How do you create programs from nothing?</li>
		<li>How do you ensure that the program architecture is beautiful?</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>This book guides you through building several programs from start to deployment. It is meant to give insight how to grow architecture without big upfront investment. Hopefully, it will also provide some insight into the questions asked previously.</p>

	<p>During programming it is very easy to get lost in all the small implementation details. Then again, when looking at the large picture, it is easy to miss small important details. These views must be balanced and treated equally, otherwise the end result will suffer.</p>

	<p>This introduction will describe the general process and terminology that will be used throughout the book.</p>
