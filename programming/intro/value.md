Quote: -- Albert Einstein

We will bring up this word a lot -- `value`. It is essential to understand
what it means. It is the reason why we are writing programs in the first place. If you are not creating something of value, we are wasting resources.

### What is valuable?

First of all, when we say something is of `value`, we mean that it brings some benefit to someone. For example:

* the internet is `valuable` because it can connect people to information with very little cost,
* a keyboard is `valuable` because it allows to interact with the computer and
* an text editor is `valuable` because it allows to modify and adjust text with ease.

### When is it valuable?

One of the important points here is that the `value` something provides is very dependent on the context where the thing exists. If there isn't any information on the internet, then its value is lessened. When there is no computer for the keyboard, then it's just a thing. Text editor isn't valuable when there is nothing to write.

Of course, it all is common sense, but it brings on few subtle points.

> Does "logging in to a system" have value?

First reaction would be to say, "Yes, of course it does?". But, let's separate it.

> Have you ever said "I got so much value out of logging into the system"?

I doubt it. So we would have to conclude that "No, of course it doesn't, it's simply an annoyance"?

As you may have guessed neither answer is correct. The goal of "logging in" is to protect value, rather than be of value. For example if the system that it protects contains no value, then "logging in" holds absolutely no value. When it's a bank system and allows to make transfers, it is as valuable as much money you have on your account. Of course, to the banks it's of huge value, because if the protection is not in place correctly, it decreases trust in that bank.

### Who benefits from the value?

There is also the aspect of who is benefiting from the `value`. Even if the internet contains a lot of information, but not in the speciality that you need -- then it is not valuable; even though it can be very valuable to someone else.

You could:

* provide value for the user,
* provide value for the designer or
* provide value for yourself.

By providing value directly to the user, we make something useful that another can directly use. If we provide value for a designer on our team, we make iterating on value faster. And by providing value to ourselves we build things that are necessary for the thing to work, but the end-user doesn't necessarily care about.

Even though the value will be directly provided to other people, you should never lose sight of the end-user... because he will be the main user of the system.

### Alternative solutions

When we talk about "logging in to a system" in some cases we could substitute with something else that has the same purpose. If I'm the only one accessing the program, do I really need to login? When a single company is using a tool internally, does it need "login", if it is not exposed on the internet?

Here we realize that there is not a single way of providing the same value, there are multiple. Some ways of providing the value are nicer for the benefitor.

### Why exactly is something valuable?

As we saw from the previous discussion, the way something provides value is essential to understand what can be used instead. For example, if we can avoid writing a "login system" and simply expose the software on a local network -- we have made the program more convenient to use and not wasted that much time on writing that "login system".

### Summary

Value will be at the core at our decision making, it helps to give us clarity why we are doing something and not doing something else.

By ensuring that each step in our building process uses value we ensure that we get something of value at the end. Try to always understand `value` at the level of end-user.
