	<p>Obviously, no book is perfect for everyone, so it helps to clarify what is expected from the reader.</p>

	<p>First, you should be familiar with programming. It is not necessary that you have written a big program, however it could help you to understand the issues better.</p>

	<p>Second, you should be able to search and learn the necessary implementation details on your own. For example, when the book requires the use of HTML, the reader should go and learn about it. It will go into technical details only when it is necessary.</p>

	<p>Third, this book uses Go, but the same principles apply to any language. The building process is the constant between languages, although the implementation details can vary significantly. If you are not familiar with Go then please learn the basics before proceeding.</p>

	<p>Throughout this book we will be doing many decisions that may not make the best business sense. For example, you shouldn't start building a issue tracker unless you have a clear ROI in mind. We may make decisions that you disagree with, these are not the important part in this book. These decisions are made during development when we don't know full information on what problems will come ahead. There will be decisions that could have made our lives easier or used a better library and so on... but this is the reality of programming: you won't make the best decisions every time.</p>
