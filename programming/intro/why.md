What is the timeless way of building programs?
What makes programs beautiful?
How do you create programs from nothing?
How do you ensure that the program architecture is beautiful?

This book guides you through building several programs from start to deployment.
It is meant to give insight how to incrementally develop architecture without
big upfront investment. Hopefully, it will also provide some insight into the
questions asked previously.

During programming it is very easy to get lost in all the small implementation
details. Then again, when looking at the large picture, it is easy to miss small
important details. These views must be balanced and treated equally, otherwise
the code will suffer.

This introduction will describe the general process and terminology that will be
used throughout the book.
