	<title>Learning</title>

	<p>One of the things people take for granted is the ability to learn. It's one of those skills that is way too often over-looked. It is a vital skill after-all.</p>

	<p>But, nevertheless, it is still a skill; something that can be improved and learned.</p>

	<p>The differences in learning can quite well explain why you end up liking some school subject over some other subject. For example if you are good with memorizing you probably end up liking history more than those that do not. Or when you try to logically derive all of the steps rather than remember formulas, you probably will be quite good in math.</p>

	<p>All subjects, to some-degree, need both.</p>

	<p>Programming is one of those subjects that requires understanding. Yes, you need to remember things, but it's nothing that much. But the difficult part is actually understanding the concepts.</p>
